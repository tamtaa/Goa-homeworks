# codewars: Remove First and Last Character Task
# Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string.
# Important: Your function should handle strings of any length â‰¥ 2 characters. 
# For strings with exactly 2 characters, return an empty string. Examples
# removeChar('eloquent') // -> 'loquen'
# removeChar('country')  // -> 'ountr' 
# removeChar('person')   // -> 'erso'
# removeChar('ab')       // -> '' (empty string)
# removeChar('xyz')      // -> 'y'
# Function Signature
# function removeChar(str) { // Your code here}
# Requirements
# The input string will always have at least 2 characters
# For strings with exactly 2 characters, return an empty string
# For strings with 3 or more characters, remove the first and last character
# The function should handle strings containing letters, numbers, and special characters
# Test Cases
# Your solution will be tested against:
# Basic functionality with common words
# Edge cases with 2-character and 3-character strings
# Strings containing numbers and special characters
# Random test cases of varying lengths
